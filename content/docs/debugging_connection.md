### Check list

* Your host is not blocking any traffic on your game server port (UDP Incoming & TCP Outgoing)

* Your game server is online to people outside of your network w/o any error on binding

* You can connect to server in-game

* You can use RCON through in-game console, if not view [TCP Error](#tcp-error) below

### "Error connecting" in server list with current 1.6 release

If you're using the current release 1.6 and experiencing connection issues in the server list (although everything looks fine in the debug tool), you should try and install the latest development version (1.x branch on GitHub). 

Note: You need to use Composer for the latest development version.

### Using the debug tool

In SourceBans++'s root directory, there's a connection debug tool named `sb_debug_connection.php`

Edit this section of that file with the corresponding server info

```
/**
 * Config part
 * Change to IP and port of the gameserver you want to test
 */
$serverip   = "";
$serverport = 27015;
$serverrcon = ""; // You only need to specify this, if you want to test the rcon tcp connection either! Leave blank if it's only the serverinfo erroring.
```

Once complete, navigate to the file in your browser, and if done properly it will attempt to connect to the specified server.

### UDP Error

* Make sure your host is not blocking <samp>UDP Incoming</samp>

* If hosting locally, make sure you are port forwarding correctly

* Make sure your game server did not ban your web server's IP using `listip`, if banned: remove it from `cfg/banned_ip.cfg` and using `removeip IP` via RCON

### TCP Error

* Make sure your host is not blocking <samp>TCP Outgoing</samp>

* Make sure your server is explicitly IP binded, do so using `-ip` launch parameter

* If you are unable to use RCON through in-game console, append `-usercon` to launch parameter
